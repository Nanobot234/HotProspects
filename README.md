HotProspects is an iOS application that allows users to quickly connect with prospects at events by scanning custom-generated QR codes. "Prospects", as used in this app,  are people whose contact information is saved by the user to be contacted at a later time. 

Original idea based on [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) bootcamp project.



## Features

- Generate a custom QR code using a user's name, email, and phone number
- Scan the QR code of another user to instantly save their contact information
- Set the event where a user meets a prospect.
- Schedule a reminder to contact a particular prospect. 



## Usage?
 You can run HotProspects by downloading it and building it in Xcode just like any other application. 

 However, the application uses a Swift package called CodeScanner so make sure to install that package before running the application.

 ## Credits

Hot Prospects is originally based on a project created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) who writes [free tutorials in Swift and SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).
