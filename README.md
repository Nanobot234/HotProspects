HotProspects is an iOS application that allows users to quickly connect with prospects at events by scanning custom-generated QR codes. "Prospects", as used in this app,  are people whose contact information is saved by the user to be contacted at a later time. 

Original idea based on [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) bootcamp project.
